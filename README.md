# Gender-classification
In this exploratory study, I investigated whether we can predict an individual's gender based on their favorite color, music genre, beverage, and soft drink. While the dataset is relatively small and gender is a complex, multifaceted concept, this project aims to learn and understand rather than make definitive decisions.
