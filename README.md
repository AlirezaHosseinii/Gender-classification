# Predicting Gender Based on Personal Preferences
In this project, we aim to determine if we can predict an individual's gender based on their personal preferences, including their favorite color, music genre, beverage, and soft drink.

## Dataset Overview

### Context

Do societal expectations lead to differences in preferences between males and females? This dataset explores whether these differences in personal preferences can be used to predict gender with an accuracy significantly higher than random chance.

### Data Description

### Dataset Features

- **Favorite Color**: The color the individual prefers.
- **Favorite Music Genre**: The genre of music the individual enjoys most.
- **Favorite Beverage**: The beverage the individual likes best.
- **Favorite Soft Drink**: The soft drink the individual prefers.

### Important Note

The dataset is not a large one, and it is not clear whether the data is of high quality or not. Gender is a complex concept that involves various fields and more serious factors, such as psychological aspects or cases where a male exhibits female behaviors, and vice versa. Therefore, the results of this project may not be certain. The primary aim of this project is to learn, not to make definitive decisions.

### Inspiration

With the rise of gender equality, the influence of gender on personal preferences has decreased. For instance, colors traditionally associated with femininity or masculinity are now viewed as less relevant. Despite this trend, this project investigates whether a reliable gender classifier can still be built based on personal preferences. What can this dataset reveal about current gender preferences?
